# GCRS - Gesture Control Robotic System

Welcome to GCRS! This project captures webcam feed, detects hand coordinates and movements, and then sends the data to an Arduino to control a dual-axis arm with servo motors.

## Features

- Detects hand movements and coordinates using a webcam.
- Sends hand position data to an Arduino for real-time control of a robotic arm.
- Utilizes OpenCV for webcam feed and image processing.
- Uses Mediapipe for hand detection.
- Employs the Firmata protocol (pyFirmata) for serial communication between Python and Arduino.
